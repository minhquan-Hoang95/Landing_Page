# Landing_Page
Today is good day to continue and to be a monster of yourself
* Today, My project is supposed to be a big learning or understanding total about HTML and CSS. So, that's why I will to myself what I'm going to do or just a plan that I'm going to lay out for my first webpage .
- Create my repository on Github and "git clone" down to my computer named "langding_Page"
- Create a folding on my computer where I'm going to put my repository within names "PROJECT_CSS"
- Create a folder styles for styles.css, a images for images and js for javascript codes later. Of course, don't forget the "index.html" in my hall.
- Have a look to analyze the image that is given bu Odin
- Create a html with for 5 sections I mean 1 header, 3 sections in the middle and a footer 
- In my header, I give two big divs for navigation bar and for landpage with "display: flex"
    -> in navigation, I give 2 divs for logo  and for link
    -> in landpage, I have 2 divs too for title and for photo
- In the section 1, I have 2 divs for title "information" and for information in detail with "display: flex" and "flex-direction: column"
    -> with the title, It easy to lay out with "text-align : center"
    -> with the information, I lay out with "display: flex" and "text-align: center"
- In section 2, I have 2 divs for quote and for author with display: flex
    -> a big stuff here, is "align-self: flex-end"
- In the section 3, I have a div " action "for all the content inside with "display: flex", "justify-content: center" and "align-items: center" to make sure my div "action" in the center of the section 3. 
    -> in my "action", I have 2 divs for words and for button with "display: flex" and "width: 900px" to create distance between 2 divs. I don't know how to separate them without "width"
- In the footer, I just give "display: flex", "justify-content:center" and align-items: center" too
